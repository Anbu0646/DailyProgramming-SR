/*
The program must accept a string S, a character CH and an integer X as the input. 
The program must remove the first X occurrences of the character CH in the string S. 
Then the program must print the modified string S as the output. 
If all the characters are removed from the string S, the program must print -1 as the output. 

Note: The string S is case sensitive. 

Boundary Condition(s): 

1 <= Length of S <= 1000 
1 <= X <= 100 

Input Format:  The first line contains S. The second line contains CH and X separated by a space. 

Output Format: The first line contains the modified string S or -1 as per the given condition(s). 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input:  

Digitization 
i 3 

Output:  Dgtzation 

Explanation: 

Here the string is Digitization. 
After removing the first 3 occurrences of i, the string becomes Dgtzation. 
Hence the output is Dgtzation. 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input:

B2b5b4@ABC 
B 4

Output:  2b5b4@AC 

Example Input/Output 3:

Input:

AAAA 
A 7

Output: -1

SOLUTION:
