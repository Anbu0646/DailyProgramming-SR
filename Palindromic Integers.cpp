/*
The program must accept two integers X and Y as the input. 
The program must print all the palindromic integers from X to Y as the output. 
If there is no palindromic integers from X to Y then the program must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= X, Y <= 10^5

Input Format:  The first line contains X and Y separated by a space. 

Output Format: The first line contains the palindromic integers from X to Y separated by a space or -1. 

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:  120 191 

Output: 121 131 141 151 161 171 181 191 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input:  455 463 

Output: -1
