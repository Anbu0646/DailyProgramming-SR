/*
The program must accept two integers X and Y where X is always greater than or equal to Y. 
The program must print the count of bits C that must be changed in Y so that it becomes X. 

Boundary Condition(s):  1 <= Y <= X <= 10^8 

Input Format:  The first line contains X and Y separated by a space. 

Output Format: The first line contains an integer value representing C. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input:  5 4 

Output: 1 

Explanation: 

The binary representation of X=5 is 101. 
The binary representation of Y=4 is 100. 
Changing the last bit we can get 5 which is X. 
Hence the output is 1. 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input:  10 6

Output: 2

SOLUTION:
