/*
The program must accept a string S as the input. 
The program must split the string S into substring values by removing all the vowels in the string S. 
Then the program must print all the substring values in the order of occurrence separated by a hyphen. 

Note: At least one consonant is always present in the string S. 

Boundary Condition(s):  1 <= Length of S <= 100 

Input Format:  The first line contains the string S. 

Output Format: The first line contains all the substring values in the order of occurrence separated by a hyphen as per the given condition. 

Example Input/Output 1:
