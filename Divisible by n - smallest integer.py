The program must accept three integers X, Y and Z as the input. 
The program must find and print the smallest positive integer N based on the following conditions. 

- N is divisible by Z. 
- N is not equal to any of the integers from X to Y (where X < Y). 

Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= X, Y, Z <= 10^8 

Input Format:  The first line contains X, Y and Z separated by a space. 

Output Format: The first line contains N. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input:  2 8 2

Output: 10 

Explanation: 

10 is the smallest integer which is divisible by 2 and it is not equal to any integers from 2 to 8. 
So 10 is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input:  5 10 4 

Output: 4
