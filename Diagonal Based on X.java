/*
The program must accept an integer matrix of size NxN and an integer X as the input. 
The program must print the output based on the following conditions. 

- If X is odd, the program must print all the integers along the main diagonal of X. 
- If X is even, the program must print all the integers along the opposite diagonal of X. 

Note: The integer X has occurred only once in the given NxN matrix. 

Boundary Condition(s): 2 <= N <= 50

Input Format:  The first line contains N. 
               The next N lines each contain N integers separated by a space. 
               The (N+2)nd line contains X. 

Output Format: The first line contains all the integers along the main diagonal or the opposite diagonal of X.
