/*
The program must accept a string S and two characters as CH1 and CH2 as the input. 
The program must print the minimum distance between CH1 and CH2 in the string S as the output. 

Note:  The characters CH1 and CH2 must be in same order as given in the input for measuring the distance. 

Boundary Condition(s): 2 <= Lenght of S <= 100 

Input Format: 

The first line contains the string S. 
The second line contains two characters separated by a space. 

Output Format: 

The first line contains the minimum distance between two characters in S. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input: 

hello  world 
o  l 

Output: 1

Explanation: 

The distance between o and l in the hello world is 4. 
The distance between o and l in the hello world is 1. 
Here the minimum distance is 1. 
Hence the output is 1 .

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input: 

may  i  know  your  good  name  
a  m 

Output: 0

SOLUTION:
