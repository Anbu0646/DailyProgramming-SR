/*
The program must accept a string S as the input. 
The program must remove the first occurrence of all the repeated consonants in the string S. 
Then the program must print the modified string S as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 3 <= Length of S <= 1000 

Input Format:  The first line contains S. 

Output Format: The first line contains the modified string S. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input:  Attendance 

Output: Atedance 

Explanation: 

The repeated consonants in the string Attendance are t and n.
So the first occurrence of both the consonants are removed from the string Attendance. 
Hence the output is Atedance. 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input:  Cloud 

Output: Cloud

Example Input/Output 3: 

Input:  OCcurrence@123 

Output: OCurence@123
