'''
Given a string S as the input, the program must print the index of the first non-repeating character in S. If it doesn't exist, the program must print -1 as the output.

Note: The index of S always starts from 0. 

Boundary Condition(s): 2 <= length of S <=100 

Input Format:  The first line contains the string S. 
Output Format: The first line contains the index of the first non-repeating character in S or -1. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input:  skillrack 
Output: 0 

Explanation: Here s is the first non-repeating character in the string "skillrack". The index of s is 0. Hence the output is 0 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input:   abbcaac
