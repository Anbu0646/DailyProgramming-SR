'''
The program must accept a string S as the input. 
For each vowel CH in the string S (from left to right), the program must remove the next character of CH from the string S. 
Then the program must print the modified string as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:  The first line contains S.

Output Format: The first line contains the modified string S. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input:  skillrack 

Output: skilrak 

Explanation:

Here the string is skillrack The first vowel in skillrack is i.
The next character of i is l, so l is removed from the string skillrack.
Now the string becomes skilrack.
The second vowel in skillrack is a. 
The next character of a is c, so c is removed from the string skilrack. 
Now the string becomes skilrak. 
Finally, the modified string skilrak is printed as the output.
