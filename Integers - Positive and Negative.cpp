/*
The program must accept N integers as the input. 
The program must print the integers which have both positive and negative values in the N integers as the output. 
The integers must be printed in the same order as given in the input.

Note:

- There will be at least one integer with both positive and negative values. 
- All the integers are always a nonzero value. 

Boundary Condition(s): 

2 <= N <= 100 
-1000 <= Each integer value <= 1000 

Input Format: 

The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space. 

Output Format: The first line contains a list of integers separated by a space as per the given conditions. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input: 

7 
10 -45 26 -10 45 10 31 

Output: 10 -45 -10 45 10 

Explanation: 

The integers 10 and 45 are present in both positive and negative values. 
Hence the output is 10 -45 -10 45 10 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input: 

6
11 12 26 -12 97 11 

Output: 12 -12

SOLUTION:
