/*
The program must accept two integers A and B as the input. 
The program must print the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of A! and B! as the output. 

Note: A! represents the factorial of A. B! represents the factorial of B. 

Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= A, B <= 20 

Input Format:  The first line contains A and B separated by a space. 

Output Format: The first line contains the GCD of (A!) and (B!). 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input:  4 3 

Output: 6

Explanation:

4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24 
3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 
The GCD of 24 and 6 is 6. 
So 6 is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input:  4 5 

Output: 24

SOLUTION:
