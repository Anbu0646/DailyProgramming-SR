/*
The program must accept a string S as the input. 
For each substring containing only vowels in the string S, the program must enclose the substring by a pair of curly braces {}. 
Then the program must print the modified string S as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= Length of S <= 100

Input Format:  The first line contains S.

Output Format: The first line contains the modified string S. 

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:  bookreading 

Output: b{oo}kr{ea}d{i}ng 

Explanation: 

Here the string is bookreading. 
The substring containing only vowels in S are oo ea and i.
So they are enclosed by the pair of curly braces {}. 
Hence the output is b{oo}kr{ea}d{i}ng.

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input:  AeIOu 

Output: {AeIOu} 

Example Input/Output 3: 

Input:  Apple

Output: {A}ppl{e}
