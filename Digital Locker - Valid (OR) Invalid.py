The program must accept two string values U and P as the input. 
U represents the username of a digital locker and P represents its password. 
The program must print VALID if the password does not contain any characters from the username U.
Else the program must print INVALID as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 

5 <= Length of U <= 50 
4 <= Length of P <= 20

Input Format: 

The first line contains U. 
The second line contains P. 

Output Format: The first line contains either VALID or INVALID. 

Example Input/Output 1:

Input: 

uit047@demo
