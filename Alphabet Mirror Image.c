/*
The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print the desired pattern as shown in the Example Input/Output section. 

Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= N <= 26 

Input Format:  The first line contains N. 
Output Format: The first N lines contain the pattern as shown in the Example Input/Output section. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input:  3 

Output: a b c * c b a
        a b * * * b a 
        a * * * * * a
        
Example Input/Output 2: 

Input:  4 

Output: a b c d * d c b a 
        a b c * * * c b a
