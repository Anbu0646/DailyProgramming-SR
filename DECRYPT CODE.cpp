/*
The program must accept a string S (encrypted string) containing only . (Dots) and - (Hyphens) as the input. 
The encryption algorithm is given below. 
- Digit 0 is encrypted as . (Single Dot). 
- Digit 1 is encrypted as -. (Hyphen and Dot). 
- Digit 2 is encrypted as -- (Two Hyphens). 
The program must decrypt the string S and print it as the output. 

Note: The string S is always a valid encrypted string. 

Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= Length of S <= 1000 

Input Format: The first line contains S. 

Output Format: The first line contains the decrypted string of S. 

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:  .-.-- 

Output: 012 

Explanation: 

012 can be decrypted as ".-.--", so 012 is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input:  --. 

Output: 20
