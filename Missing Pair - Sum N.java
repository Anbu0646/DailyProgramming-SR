/*
The program must accept all the possible pairs of positive integers except one pair, where the sum of two integers in each pair is equal to N as the input. 
The program must print the missing pair of integers which gives the sum N as the output. 

Note: The integers in each pair are always sorted in ascending order. 

Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= Each integer value <= 1000 

Input Format: The first line contains a list of pairs separated by a space, where each pair contains two integers separated by a comma and enclosed within parentheses. 

Output Format: The first line contains two integers separated by comma and enclosed within parentheses. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input:  (1,4) 

Output: (2,3)

Explanation: 

The two possible pairs that give the sum 5 are (1,4) and (2,3). 
Here, the missing pair is (2,3). 
So (2,3) is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input:  (10,10) (4,16) (1,19) (2,18) (7,13) (6,14) (9,11) (3,17) (5,15) 

Output: (8,12) 

Example Input/Output 3: 

Input:  (3,3) (2,4)

Output: (1,5)
