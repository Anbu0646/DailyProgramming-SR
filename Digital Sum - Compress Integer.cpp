/*
The program must accept an integer N as the input. 
The program must compress the integer N by concatenating the digital sum of every two consecutive digits. 
Then the program must print the modified value of N as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 10 <= N <= 10^9 

Input Format: The first line contains the value of N. 

Output Format: The first line contains the modified value of N. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input:  208914 

Output: 28815 

Explanation: 

The digital sum of 2 and 0 is 2 
The digital sum of 0 and 8 is 8 
The digital sum of 8 and 9 is 8 
The digital sum of 9 and 1 is 1 
The digital sum of 1 and 4 is 5 
Hence the output is 28815 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input:  1234 

Output: 357

SOLUTION:
