/*
The program must accept an integer N as the input. 
The program must find all the combinations of the digits in the integer N. 
Then the program must print the combinations which are the factors of N in ascending order as the output. 
If there is no such combination then the program must print -1 as the output. 

Note: Exclude 1 and N from the factors of N. 

Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= N <= 999999999 

Input Format:  The first line contains N. 

Output Format: The lines each contain an integer or the first line contains -1. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input:  12345 

Output: 

3 
5 
15 

Explanation: 

The integer N (12345) is divisible by 3, 5 and 15 which are all the combinations of the digits in the integer 12345. 
3 5 15 are already in sorted order.
So the output is 3 5 15. 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input:  21

Output: -1
