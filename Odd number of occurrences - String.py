The program must accept a string S as the input. 
The program must print the characters with an odd number of occurrences in the order of their occurrence in S as the output. 
If there is no such character in the string S then the program must print -1 as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 2 <= Length of S <= 1000 

Input Format:  The first line contains S. 

Output Format: The first line contains the characters with an odd number of occurrences in the order of their occurrence in S.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:  nneettwwoorkwo 

Output: work

Explanation:
