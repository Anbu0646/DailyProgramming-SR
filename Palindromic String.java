/*
The program must accept a string S containing only lower case alphabets as the input.
The program must print all the palindromic substring values of length 3 in the string S as the output. 
If there is no such palindromic substring, the program must print -1 as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= Length of S <= 100 

Input Format:  The first line contains S.

Output Format: The lines contain the palindromic substring values of length 3 or the first line contains -1. 

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:  eyelens 

Output: eye ele 

Explanation: Two palindromic substring values of length 3 in the string eyelens are eye and ele. 

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:  skillrack
