'''
The program must accept three integers as the input. The program must calculate the product of all the possible combinations of two integers among the three integers. 
Then the program must print the sum of unique product values. 

Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= Three integer values <= 10^6

Input Format:  The first line contains the three integers separated by a space. 
Output Format: The first line contains the sum as per the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:  10 5 7
Output: 155 

Explanation: The product of all the possible combinations of two integers are 50, 35 and 70. So their sum is 155.

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input:  5 10 5 
Output: 75


SOLUTION:
