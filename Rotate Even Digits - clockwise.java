/*
The program must accept an integer N as the input. 
The program must rotate the even digits of N in their positions by 1 time in the clockwise direction. 
Then the program must print the modified integer N as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 100 <= N <= 10^18

Input Format:  The first line contains N. 

Output Format: The first line contains the modified integer N.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:  5233487 

Output: 5433827 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input:  1002 

Output: 1020 

Example Input/Output 3: 

Input:  400352

Output: 2354 

Explanation: 

After rotating the even digits of 400352 in their positions by 1 time in the clockwise direction, the integer becomes 002354.
Now the leading zeros in 002354 have been removed and it is printed as output.
