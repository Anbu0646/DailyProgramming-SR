/*
The program must accept N integers as the input. 
The program must remove the trailing zeros for all the N integers. 
Then the program must print the smallest integer among the N modified integers as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 

1 <= N <= 100 
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^8 

Input Format: 

The first line contains N. 
The second line contains N integers separated by a space. 

Output Format: 

The first line contains the smallest integer among the N modified integers. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input: 

5 
150 2000 50 8800 24 

Output: 2 

Explanation: 

After removing the trailing zeros in the five integers, the integers become 15 2 5 88 24. 
Now the smallest integer is 2. 
So 2 printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input:

4 
10 19 457 1000000 

Output: 1

SOLUTION:
