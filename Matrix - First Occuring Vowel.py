The program must accept a character matrix of size RxC as the input. 
The program must print the first occurring vowels from the top in each column of the matrix as the output.

Note: At least one vowel is always occurred in each column of the matrix. 

Boundary Condition(s): 2 <= R, C <= 100 

Input Format: 

The first line contains R and C separated by a space. 
The next R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space. 

Output Format: The first line contains the first occurring vowels from the top in each column of the matrix. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input:

4 4 
H N L A 
y S I O 
h a O # 
e F @ a 

Output: eaIA 

Explanation: 

The first occurring vowels from the top in each column of the matrix are highlighted below. 

H N L A 
y S I O 
h a O # 
e F @ a 

So eaIA is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input: 

3 7 
o f w
$ w E 
d t v
M i O 
i 1 2
E e @
