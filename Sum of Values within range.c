/*
N integers are passed as the input to the program. Two integers X and Y (X <= Y) are also passed as the input to the program. 
The program must print the sum of the values among these N integers which are from X to Y (inclusive of X and Y). 

Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= N <= 100 
                      -10^5 <= X <= Y <= 10^5
                      -10^5 <= Each integer value <= 10^5 

Input Format:  The first line contains the value of N, X and Y separated by a space. 
               The second line contains N integer values separated by a space. 
Output Format: The first line contains the sum of the values in the range from X to Y. 

Example Input/Output 1: 
Input:  5 -100 100 
        10 -30 400 -500 0 
Output: -20

Explanation: The integer values which are between -100 and 100 are 10 -30 0 and their sum is -20 which is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input:   10 -600 500 
         787 561 214 -586 879 647 -893 -617 152 -990 
Output: -220
