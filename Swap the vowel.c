/*
The program must accept two string values S1 and S2 containing only alphabets. 
The number of vowels in S1 will always be equal to the number of vowels in S2. 
The program must replace the vowels in S2 with the vowels in S1 in the same order of occurrence and vice versa.
Finally, the program must print the modified string values S1 and S2 as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= Length of S1, S2 <= 100 

Input Format: 

The first line contains the string S1. 
The second line contains the string S2. 

Output Format: 

The first line contains the modified string S1. 
The second line contains the modified string S2.

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input: 

apple 
mango 

Output: 

applo 
mange 

Explanation: 

The vowels in "apple" are a and e. 
The vowels in "mango" are a and o.
