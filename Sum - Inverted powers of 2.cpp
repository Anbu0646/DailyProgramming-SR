/*
The program must accept an integer N as the input. 
The program must generate a sequence of integers containing the integers from 1 to N.
Then the program must invert the sign of all the powers of 2 in the generated sequence.
Finally, the program must print the sum of all the integers in the modified sequence as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= N <= 10^4

Input Format:  The first line contains N.

Output Format: The first line contains the sum of all the integers in the modified sequence. 

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:   4 

Output: -4 

Explanation: 

Here N=4, so the sequence is 1 2 3 4.
After inverting the sign of all the powers of 2, the sequence becomes -1 -2 3 -4. 
Now the sum of integers in the sequence is -4. 
Hence the output is -4.

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:  10 

Output: 25

SOLUTION:
