/*

The program must accept the value of a string S as the input. 
The program must print the maximum number of alphabets between any two consecutive same alphabets in the string as the output. 
If there is no such repeated alphabet, then the program must print -1 as the output. 

Note: The string S contains only lowercase alphabets. 

Boundary Condition(s): 3 <= Length of String S <= 99 

Input Format: The first line contains the value of S. 

Output Format: The first line contains the maximum number of characters between two same alphabets. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input:  helloh 

Output: 4
