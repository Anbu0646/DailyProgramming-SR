If there is no X characters to print then print the remaining characters as it is. 

Boundary Condition(s):  2 <= Length of S <= 10000
                        1 <= X <= Length of S 

Input Format:   The first line contains the string S.
                The second line contains the integer X. 

Output Format:  The lines contain X characters on each line as per the given conditions.
